Heuristic Evaluation is a method that involves evaluating a website or product based on established usability principles and guidelines. The survey we conducted followed this method, and we asked questions that assessed the website's compliance with these principles. This helped us to identify any areas where the website could be improved in terms of user experience and functionality. Involving a colleague with industry expertise further added to the credibility of our evaluation process. By having someone with extensive knowledge of the industry examine the website, we were able to gain a fresh perspective on the interface and receive a second opinion on its usability and compliance with established principles.</h5>

        <h5>First Strike Capital was established with the goal of driving the growth of investor capital. However, our team has noticed that the current website is not effectively serving this purpose. We have identified several issues with the website, including a lack of relevant information, an unattractive web interface, and the absence of a Chinese translation. These shortcomings are causing potential investors to look elsewhere and reducing the amount of web traffic to the site. As the majority of investors are based in China, the lack of a Chinese translation is particularly detrimental to the company's goals. Our aim is to address these issues and enhance the website to attract more investors and increase web traffic.</h5>

By relying on the mind map, our team can ensure that we are all on the same page and can logically plan out the overall appearance of the website.
