This can result in a frustrating user experience, causing visitors to leave the site without making a purchase. Additionally, the website's content is not easily readable or comprehendible, making it challenging for users to understand what the website is selling. These factors combined can make it difficult for the client to achieve their goal of increasing traffic and online purchases. </h5>

This approach allowed us to quickly start the design and development process without getting overly entangled in the finer details of user behavior.

This helped us to develop more effective solutions by giving us a better insight into the users' pain points, requirements, objectives, and key characteristics.</h5>

The aim of this test was to evaluate what information users retain and what kind of first impression they form within the first five seconds of viewing the website. The feedback we received from the test was largely consistent with our own observations as a team, which strengthened our confidence in our approach to redesigning the website.

However, our team has noticed that the current layout and organization of the website may be hindering the user experience and causing potential customers to leave the site without making a purchase. The disorganized layout and navigation system of the site can make it challenging for users to quickly and easily find the items they are interested in. This can lead to frustration and a decreased likelihood of users making a purchase on the site.</h5>

            <h5 class="col-md-6 left-align">We utilize a mood board to coordinate the inspiration for our project and sharpen its style before embarking on the actual design process.

Our team members source valuable resources to maintain a consistent style and aesthetic throughout the project. The mood board serves as a central reference point, and we frequently consult it to ensure that everyone is aligned. We were greatly inspired by Cornella's simple approach to an online book shop, particularly their light font weight. Our design aims to be charming and playful with strategically placed pops of color to add some visual interest.</h5>
